## IMPLEMENTATION OF ANT COLONY IN ROUTE OPTIMIZATION BEETWEEN DISTRICT OFFICES IN SURABAYA

The project "Implementation of Ant Colony in Route Optimization between District Offices in Surabaya" focuses on utilizing the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to find the most efficient routes connecting district offices in Surabaya. This project aims to minimize travel distance and time between these offices by applying the principles of ACO, which is inspired by the natural behavior of ants in finding the shortest paths. The algorithm works by simulating how ants deposit pheromones on different routes, reinforcing the optimal paths based on their efficiency. By implementing this approach, the project seeks to enhance logistical efficiency and reduce operational costs for activities that involve inter-office transportation and communication within the city.
